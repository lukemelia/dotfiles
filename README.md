My personal dotfiles managed by [`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) ([More information on rcp on the thoughtbot blog](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos))



## Thanks


This originally started as a fork of [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman)'s 
[dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles). It was an excellent place to learn many interesting tweaks. I've yet to convert to ZSH so my fork diverged a lot so I eventually made my own. Many of the scripts and some of the files are still straight up copies of his.
